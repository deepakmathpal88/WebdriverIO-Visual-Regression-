# WebdriverIO example

I modefied the https://github.com/zinserjan/webdriverio-example project to test a simple visual regression scnario.You can get moe detail from the specified URL for the operations used in th project.

## Getting started

Before running, make sure, you have below version of node in in your machine:
 `node -v --> v8.9.4`
This is not mandatory. But I stuck with diffrnt errors when i had a difrent node version.
Ths is the way to use diffrrnt node version in your machins.

 It uses:
 `wdio-selenium-standalone-service": "^0.0.12"`


To Run it: 

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run test`

Ths test case will initially fail as I have put a diffren image in refrence foldr. You can delete that file befor runnng.
